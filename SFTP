SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is the secure version of the normal FTP. SFTP is comparable to SCP (Secure Copy) but permits more interactive process.

[jason@spacewalk .ssh]$ sftp student@192.168.122.74
Connected to student@192.168.122.74.
sftp> ls
sftp> lls
id_rsa	id_rsa.pub  known_hosts
sftp> pwd
Remote working directory: /home/student
sftp> lpwd
Local working directory: /home/jason/.ssh
sftp> whoami

In the above example, 192.168.122.74 is the remote host. A number of commands like 'ls' can be used to navigate and list files
on the remote host and you can also do the same on the server you are connecting from, while maintaining the remote SSH session.

You can move files using commands such as:

get
-receives the file from the remote machine to the local machine

put
-uploads the file from the local machine to the remote machine (opposite of 'get')
